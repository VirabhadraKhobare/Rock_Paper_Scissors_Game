# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

## Description
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. The game allows the user to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects one of the three. The winner is determined based on the standard rules:

The game also displays ASCII art for each choice.

##Known Issues
  ⚠️ The program crashes if the user inputs a number other than 0, 1, or 2. Consider adding input 
  validation to handle incorrect inputs properly.

##Future Improvements
  - Add a loop to allow multiple rounds.
  - Improve input validation.
  - Keep track of scores.
